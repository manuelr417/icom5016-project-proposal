# ICOM 5016 Fall 2016
## Term Project Proposal
###Introduction
In this course, you are require to complete a term project consisting of some app that uses a database system for storage purposes. The app can be any of: 

1. Web application
2. Mobile web application
3. Native mobile application

You application must be organized in terms of web services, and follow a [three-tier architecture](http://www.slideshare.net/sanjeevwebx/3-tier-architecture-2410697): 

1. Client-tier - this is layer that implements the client application, which provides the User-Interface (UI) for the user to interact with the system.
2. Application-tier - this is the layer that provides the business-logic for the application. This is a server-side tier, and must be implemented using [RESTful web services](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069). 
3. Server-tier - this is the layer that provides storage for the applicaitons. It must be implemented using a relational database system.

The project will be developed by teams of three (3) students. The project will have four (4) phases:

1. Phase I - Project Proposal - you will explain, in 2 pages, the idea of the project.
2. Phase II - App Design and ER model - implement the UI and provide the ER model for the system.
3. Phase III - Relational Design and Support for Reads - implement the DB tables and the web services needed to read data. 
4. Phase III - Support for Updates - finish the DB tables and implement the insert/update/delete web services.


### Software Guidelines
Your project must be submitted thru a GitHub repository. The URL of the repository will be requested by the professor via email. 

You can use the following tools for the client app:

1. Angular JS
2. React JS
3. HTML5 and CSS3 (e.g., Bootstrap)
4. Android
5. iOS

You can use the following tools for the server app:

1. Java Play
2. Python Flask
3. Node.JS

All projects must issue SQL queries to the DB. The use of Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) libraries is prohibited. Projects that use ORM will get a score of 0. 

### Project Ideas
The following is a list of potential project ideas that you might pursue:

1. Social networks
2. Tourist guides
3. Apps for inventory management
4. Apps for sales (e.g., cars, crafts, clothing)
5. Photo/video album apps
6. Medical record apps
