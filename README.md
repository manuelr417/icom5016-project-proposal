## Term Project Proposal
###Introduction
In this course, you are require to complete a term project consisting of some app that uses a database system for storage purposes. The app can be any of: 

1. Web application
2. Mobile web application
3. Native mobile application

You application must be organized in terms of web services, and follow a [three-tier architecture](http://www.slideshare.net/sanjeevwebx/3-tier-architecture-2410697): 

1. Client-tier - this is layer that implements the client application, which provides the User-Interface (UI) for the user to interact with the system.
2. Application-tier - this is the layer that provides the business-logic for the application. This is a server-side tier, and must be implemented using [RESTful web services](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069). 
3. Server-tier - this is the layer that provides storage for the applicaitons. It must be implemented using a relational database system.

The project will be developed by teams of three (3) students. The project will have four (4) phases:

1. Phase I - Project Proposal - you will explain, in 2 pages, the idea of the project.
2. Phase II - App Design and ER model - implement the UI and provide the ER model for the system.
3. Phase III - Relational Design and Support for Reads - implement the DB tables and the web services needed to read data. 
4. Phase III - Support for Updates - finish the DB tables and implement the insert/update/delete web services.


### Software Guidelines
Your project must be sunbmitted thru a GitHub repository.
